contrib:
  # Path to your git repository. to run git blame on.
  # Consider making this a git submodule. For the GitHub action, if this
  # path doesn't exist you can define the GitHub clone url as "repo"
  repo:   ./spack

  # JSON file mapping authors to organizations (optional)
  # If you add this here, make sure to set the action "authors" to true
  orgmap: ./author-to-org.json

  # Separate parts of the repository to process (optional).  For each
  # commit, contrib will look for files that match the patterns in each
  # part.  For a simple repo, you may only need one regular expression
  # per part.  In Spack, the packages have moved around in the repo over
  # time, so we provide multiple patterns.  Contrib will use the first
  # pattern matched by any file in each commit. Note that we are only
  # parsing files that start with s to make it faster for the example.
